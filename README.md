## Troubleshooting
**Before opening an issue on GitHub, make sure no one has had a similar problem that has been resolved.**

### The app opens, but the content shows an error page.
Make sure you are connected to the Internet. Butterfly will not work without a working connection.


### The app never opens, or it opens and immediately closes.
Delete the settings file and re-run the app. For Windows, this is at `%APPDATA%/Butterfly/Settings.json | C:/Users/{userName}/AppData/Roaming/Butterfly/Settings.json`. For macOS, this is at `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Butterfly/Settings.json | /Users/{userName}/Library/Application Support/Butterfly/Settings.json`. For Linux, this is `$HOME/.local/share/Butterfly/Settings.json | /home/{userName}/.local/share/Butterfly/Settings.json`."

### I cannot install or uninstall a mod.
Make sure Hollow Knight is not running.

### I cannot enable/disable the Modding API
[Verify the integrity](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB) of your Hollow Knight files through Steam, then restart Butterfly.
